#### DEAD END SECTION BECAUSE APT-GET INSTALL OLD MINIZINC IT SEEMS and I DON'T THINK IT SUPPORTS because see `mzn-fzn: Unrecognized option or bad format `--compile'`
#### I KNOW IT IS OLD BECAUSE AFTER USING, `apt.txt` to install it I CAN CHECK IN SESSION AFTER WITH `dpkg -L minizinc` TO SEE WHAT APT-GET INSTALLED,
#### BASED ON https://www.devmanuals.net/install/ubuntu/ubuntu-16-04-LTS-Xenial-Xerus/how-to-install-minizinc.html . Then 
#### with `cat /usr/share/doc/minizinc/copyright` I can see if is `Copyright: 2014-2018 Monash University and NICTA ` I think `mzn-fzn` is the program to
#### to run because pointing it at the model like at https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.6.4/en/basic_steps.html#the-minizinc-command-line-tool gives result shown there. 
# make aliases to executables in what conda installed for minizinc
####cd ~/.local/bin
####n -s /usr/bin/mzn-fzn minizinc

# Move minizinc installation to here because I cannot see how to use `minizinc` on command line when using apt-get installed one AND IT SEEMS OLD !!!
